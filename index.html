                <h2>Web Development, automations, basketball, hip-hop, games & cooking</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Bryan Romero Marsaro and i glad that you arrived there. Personally saying i like to use three words to describe myself, adaptability, criativity and easygoing.
                <p>Talking a little bit more about my passions, as you can see in the title, programming holds a special place in my heart. I find joy in solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. It's a constantly evolving field that fuels my curiosity and pushes me to learn new technologies.</p>
                <p>Competing is another aspect that fuels my spirit. Whether on the basketball court, where I can showcase my teamwork and leadership skills, or in the virtual realm of gaming, where strategic thinking and quick decision-making come into play, I thrive in competitive environments.</p>
                <p>Beyond the digital world, you'll often find me in the kitchen experimenting with recipes and exploring the art of cooking. There's something incredibly satisfying about crafting a delicious meal from scratch and sharing it with others.</p>
                <p>And, of course, there's hiphop music, a constant companion in my journey. The beats, the rhythm, and the storytelling within the lyrics resonate with me on a deep level. It's more than just a genre; it's a source of inspiration and motivation that accompanies me through various aspects of life.</p>                </p>
